## Introduction

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket has become a revolutionary force in the space industry, with a track record of numerous successful launches. However, predicting the outcome of each launch can be challenging due to the complex interplay of various factors. This project employs Data Science techniques and Machine Learning models to create a predictive tool for launch outcomes. By doing so, we aim to improve the understanding of the factors that contribute to successful launches and reduce the risks associated with space missions.

## Data

The success of this project relies on quality data. We use historical data from SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches, which include information about launch dates, mission names, payloads, launch outcomes, and various other technical parameters. The dataset is available in the `data` directory.

## Methodology

Our predictive model employs a combination of Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning techniques. The following libraries are central to our project:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

The detailed methodology and data processing steps can be found in the Jupyter Notebook located in the `notebooks` directory.

## Code Structure

The project repository has the following structure:

```
- data/              # Contains the dataset
- notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling
- README.md          # This documentation
```

## Setup and Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jgfurlan/Capstone.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies (as mentioned in the "Setup and Installation" section).

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the data analysis and modeling process.

4. Run the Python code in the `src` directory to train and evaluate the predictive model.

## Results

Our project's final report, detailing the model's performance and insights gained from the analysis, can be found in the `notebooks` directory. The results and findings are summarized in the report.
